## Data 
- `data/` contains the dataset for the project
- `code/` will contain codes that produces tables and plots
- `output/` will contain output that successfully run 


## Initial Code Description
`data/load_ocddata.R`
- Run all the codes in this Rscript to load the data.

`code/01_make_output.R`
- Generates the table that provides insights into the education level, and marital status, reported by individuals of different ethnicities within the OCD patient dataset
- Generates the required figure using `gtsummary`
- Saves the table as `.rds` object in the `output/` folder

`code/02_make_output.R`
- Analyzes the relationship between demographic factors, duration of symptoms, OCD types, and severity
- Generates the required figure using `ggplot2`
- Renders the final report using `report.Rmd`
