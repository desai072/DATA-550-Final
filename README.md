OCD Patients DATA 550 Final

## Introduction and Objectives

This report analyzes the `ocd_patient_dataset.csv` dataset, which contains information on demographic details, clinical information, symptom severity, co-occurring mental health conditions, medication history, and family history of patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The objectives of this analysis are:

- Explore the demographic characteristics of OCD patients
- Analyze the demographic and duration of symptoms, obsession type, and compulsive type
- Identify if there are any patterns or trends in certain ethnicities or family history of OCD

## Data 
- `data/` contains the dataset for the project
- `code/` will contain codes that produces tables and plots
- `output/` will contain output that successfully run 


## Initial Code Description
`code/01_data_loading.R`
- Loads the `ocd_patient_dataset.csv` data file into R

`code/02_demographic_table.R`
- Generates the table that provides insights into the education level reported by individuals of different ethnicities within the OCD patient dataset
- Saves the table as `.rds` object in the `output/` folder

`code/03_graph_analysis.R`
- Analyzes the relationship between demographic factors, duration of symptoms, OCD types, and severity
- Generates the required figure using `ggplot2`
- Renders the final report using `report.Rmd`

## Output Directory

- `Demographics_Table.csv`: This file contains the table that provides insights into the education level reported by individuals of different ethnicities within the OCD patient dataset, generated by `code/02_demographic_table.R`.

- `Graph_Analysis.png`: This file contains the figure that visualizes the relationship between demographic factors, duration of symptoms, OCD types, and severity, generated by `code/03_graph_analysis.R`.

- `Final_Report.pdf`: This file contains the final report rendered from `report.Rmd`, which integrates the analysis, tables, and figures generated by the code scripts.

Please ensure that the `output/` directory is included in the repository and contains these files after running the initial code scripts.


`report.Rmd`
- Reads the tables and figures generated by `code/02_demographic_table.R` and `code/03_graph_analysis.R`
- Integrates the analysis, tables, and figures into the final report
